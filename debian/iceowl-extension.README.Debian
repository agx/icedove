Important Security Notice
-------------------------
There's no upstream security support for iceowl and iceowl-extension since
lightning is still under development without an officially supported version by
upstream. New lightning upstream versions add features and require new
icedove/thunderbird versions to function.

Therefore Debian doesn't offer official security support for this package.
