Upstream-Name: Thunderbird
Name: Iceweasel
Source: http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/thunderbird/
Disclaimer: The original upstream tarball is modified from upstream by
 removing a set of sourceless binary, non-free, and VCS-related files. You
 can find a repack.py script in the debian directory doing this cleanup,
 using filtering data present in a source.filter file in the same directory.
 If this file is incomplete, which I'm pretty sure is the case, because it's
 difficult not to forget anything in this huge amount of data, please file
 a bug or contact me.
 Some licensing terms are not included verbatim in this file on purpose, for
 terms that are available in a file in subdirectories that are not used to
 build the binary packages.
