icedove (24.5.0-1~deb7u1) stable-security; urgency=low

  Due to a symbol versioning problem (#745593) Mozilla Ligthning isn't
  compatible with Icedove 24. Please use the Debian package
  iceowl-extension instead. To do so run icedove in safe-mode (icedove
  -safe-mode), uninstall lightning and afterwards install iceowl-extension
  via apt.

  A fix to make Lightning and Icedove compatible again is in the works.

icedove (3.0.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  The old profile folder ~/.mozilla-thunderbird will renamed into ~/.icedove on
  the first startup of icedove 3.0. So if you in trouble with it, make a
  backup before starting icedove 3.0.
