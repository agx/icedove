# LOCALIZATION NOTE (IsIndexPromptWithSpace): The last character of the string 
# should be a space (U+0020) in most locales. The prompt is followed by an

IsIndexPromptWithSpace=這是一個可搜尋的索引。請輸入關鍵字:\u0020
ForgotPostWarning=表格含有 enctype=%S 但未使用 method=post。傳送時會使用 method=GET 且忽略 enctype 設定。
ForgotFileEnctypeWarning=表格含有上傳檔案的輸入，但未使用 method=POST 與 enctype=multipart/form-data。檔案將不會被上傳。
# LOCALIZATION NOTE (DefaultFormSubject): %S will be replaced with brandShortName
DefaultFormSubject=來自 %S 的表單
CannotEncodeAllUnicode=有一張使用 %S 編碼送出的表單無法對所有的 Unicode 字元進行編碼，所以使用者所輸入的東西可能發生錯誤。若要避免這個問題，應該修改此網頁，或是在表單元素上指定 accept-charset=utf-8，以透過 UTF-8 編碼送出表單。
